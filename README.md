# Assignment4

I used Text and Pressable components from react-native
I downloaded "react-native-date-picker" library.
When you click "Date Picker" button datepicker modal is opening and you become able to select date. When you select program set is to one state and in the bottom side of screen it shows the date.

Library that used: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-date-picker
